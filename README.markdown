# THIS IS A VERY OLD PROJECT. It's not longer compatible with the current release of podio-php and will not work out of the box. I keep it here for historical reasons. It will not work unless you port the code to the current state of podio-php yourself.

# Podio API Sample: Virtual Scrumboard
This is a simple example of how you can build specialized visual interfaces on top of Podio. It creates a virtual scrumboard based on Podio. You control all your sprints inside Podio and use the virtual scrumboard to get an overview of the state for your current sprint.

This allows all team members to stay on the same page even if they are not in the same physical location. Perfect for split teams or just for when you are working from home. The virtual scrumboard also uses the reporting widgets to calculate the sum of hours left in the current sprint and tells you if the team is on track or not.

When you open the scrumboard you will see a quick overview of all the features to be implemented. A bullet graph shows the current progress and you can glance at how many cards are done. Clicking on a feature shows a traditional scrumboard for that feature. You can use drag and drop to move story cards from state to state and work progresses and any changes will of course be reflected on Podio. You can even attach responsible developers so you can see on the scrumboard who is responsible for a story card.

This PHP app was built using the [Limonade](http://www.limonade-php.net/) micro-framework and the [Podio PHP client](https://github.com/podio/podio-php).

# Creating your Podio apps
You will need three apps to run the scrumboard: Sprints (sets the daterange for a sprint), Stories (for each feature to be implemented) and Story Items (for each task inside a feature). Grab the [Scrum Development Pack](https://podio.com/store/app/2267-scrum-development) from the Podio App Store to get started.

# Setting up the scrumboard
* Add some content to your apps
* Copy config.php.example to config.php and add your credentials for Podio and add the appropriate IDs from your Podio apps. Nb. You can find field IDs by [getting the apps from the developer site](https://developers.podio.com/doc/applications/get-app-22349).
* Run index.php in your browser
